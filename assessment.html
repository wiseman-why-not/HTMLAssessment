        <h2>Why Does Dallas Suck!</h2>
        <br>
        <p><strong>You're</strong> not gonna believe this, because it usually never happens, but I made a mistake. You look it up, you don't- you don't even know what it means. Then it's time to get your beak wet tonight playa! Your failures are your own, old man! I say, follow throooough!</p>
        <blockquote cite="http://">
          <p><em><strong>Hello</strong> Jerry, come to rub my face in urine again? Alan Rails, ladies and gentlemen. After his parents' tragic death in a railroad accident, he gained the power to summon ghost trains. It's not all bad though, they were spared having to see their grown son wear a whistle. Rubber baby buggy bumpers! Yea. If you spend all day shuffling words around you can make anything sound bad, Morty.<em></p>

        <p><strong>Wow</strong> I really crononberg'd up the whole place huh Morty, just a bunch a cronenbergs walkin around. Nobody's killing me until after I catch my wife with another man. You're growing up fast, Morty. You're going into a great big thorn straight into my ass. That, out there. That's my grave. On one of our adventures Rick and I basically destroyed the whole world.</p>
